Thank you for downloading this set of images :)

It contains 18 buttons of the different Pokemon types in 220x60px.

You can use them for free for non-commercial projects, but I would really appreciate it if you'd fav this on dA
and/or even backlink me. And please leave a comment at my dA account showing me the things
you creatied with these :) Thanks a lot!

PS: You may not repost them anywhere without my permission and you may not spread them as your own. Just be fair.
